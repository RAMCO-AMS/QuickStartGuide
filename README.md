# Quick Start Guide
This is a simple project that will get you quickly running queries against the RAMCO API. The only prequisites for this project are a webserver that supports PHP and cURL.

After entering the key you recieve from your RAMCO Product Manager, this script will poll the API for a list of all entities in the system, and then perform a simple query on all contacts.
